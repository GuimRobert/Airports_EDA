# AIRPORTS EDA Project

## Overview
This project focuses on loading, cleaning, and analyzing data related to airports and ports worldwide. The analysis includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and data manipulations to gain insights into the dataset.

## Files
- **Data_Analysis/Airports_EDA/Airports.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded from a specified URL and headers were manually included for each column.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Histograms and violin plots were used to visualize the distribution of numerical variables.
   - A world map was created to display airport density.
   - Categorical variables were analyzed and visualized.
3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Null values were identified and handled by replacing them with appropriate values.
   - Data types were converted to categorical for specific columns.
4. **Optional Extension**:
   - An additional analysis was conducted on airline sizes and flight distances.
   - The correlation between airline size and distance was explored.

## Results
- The project provides insights into airport data, including airport types, countries, and cities.
- Statistical summaries and visualizations help in understanding the dataset.
- The correlation analysis between airline size and flight distances revealed interesting findings.
